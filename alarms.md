### Daily alarm functionality

#### There are some limitations to the ESPHome time support, so please read carefully - it will require some setup.

The setup contains several sensors and switches, and two services.

First, let's setup the time zone on your satellite.

By default, ESPHome has time zone, that was set on your build environment (add-on, Docker container etc.). We don't want your alarm to ring at wrong time, so we need to set correct time zone to the device.
It's done once, and will be preserved on reboots.

- Go to [this page](https://github.com/nayarsystems/posix_tz_db/blob/fb5fa340cfa7599467358a347e5d6e6724d92bb2/zones.csv) and find your time zone.
- Copy the POSIX value from the right column. For me (Vancouver) it's `PST8PDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0`.
- Go to `Developer tools - Actions` in your Home Assistant. We need to call action `esphome.{your_device_name}_set_time_zone`. Use copied POSIX TZ value for `posix_time_zone` field.
- After calling that action, proceed to your satellite device page and check that sensor `Current device time` is showing correct time.

That's it, initial setup is ready.

To set the alarm time, use action `esphome.{your_device_name}_set_alarm_time`. 
- The time should be set in 24-hour format `HH:MM` (for example, `07:30`, please pay attention to leading zero).
- The sensor `Alarm time` will reflect current value.

To activate alarm, turn on the switch `Alarm on`. *ATTENTION! If it's off, alarm won't ring!*

Now to the action. Find drop-down `Alarm action` and adjust it to your preference, what action should happen on alarm ring:
- `Play sound`: satellite will play same sound that is played when timer is ringing. This can be stopped with "stop" word.
- `Send event`: satellite will sent event `esphome.alarm_ringing`, which you can use in your automations to play music, open your window blinds or any other action of your choice.
- `Sound and event` - both local sound playback and event sending will be executed.

That's it! Enjoy your new alarm!
